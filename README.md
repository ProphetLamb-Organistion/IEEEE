# IEEE754Converter

Aims to provide universal and generic conversion between decimal and scientific number representations and the storage bytes of IEEE 754 floating point numbers.

The code is not supposed to be used in rt-libaries for obious performance defficits, but to precomute constants for custom implementations of floating point numbers (such as https://github.com/coder0xff/QPFloat) with high precision and little effort.
